        <p class="idea-text" id="idea1-01">The first time I entered the Significa's office I was amazed. Coolest workspace ever!</p>

        <p class="idea-text" id="idea1-02">A big surprise for me was how young everyone was, as well as the number of people that worked here.</p>

        <p class="idea-text" id="idea1-03">A mix of on-site and remote work was kind of a novelty for me. What at first already felt like a lot of people then grew in perspective.</p>

        <p class="idea-text" id="idea1-04">My first days combined a mix of excitement and fear, feeling a little bit overwhelmed by how new everything was.</p>

        <p class="idea-text" id="idea1-05">I had no idea about all the different roles that can take part on a digital agency. I even believed that Nuno was a designer.</p>

        <p class="idea-text" id="idea1-06">The internal pressure to do good and to not mess up was very real.</p>

        <p class="idea-text" id="idea1-07">Despite of this the atmosphere was very easy going. I felt really welcomed as everyone was so kind and friendly.</p>

        <p class="idea-text" id="idea1-08">On my first days I worked on the design challenges and that was definitely A challenge...</p>

        <p class="idea-text" id="idea1-09">My belief that I knew very little of the UI sphere was amplified. Gladly the amazing design team was there to help me do better :)</p>

        <p class="idea-text" id="idea1-010">Still those challenges should remain in the trash until further notice.</p>

        <p class="idea-text" id="idea2-01">Many were the learnings that I took from this experience, but some were quite remarkable. Here they go:</p>

        <p class="idea-text" id="idea2-02">Don't be afraid to make mistakes. Explore, explore and explore.</p>

        <p class="idea-text" id="idea2-03">You can only be as good as your references. Choose them wisely.</p>

        <p class="idea-text" id="idea2-04">Team work makes the dream work.</p>

        <p class="idea-text" id="idea2-05">The client isn't always right. We are the experts.</p>

        <p class="idea-text" id="idea2-06">Good communication is the key.</p>

        <p class="idea-text" id="idea2-07">Always ask the three questions. What, how and why.</p>

        <p class="idea-text" id="idea2-08">First learn the rationale, then explore the tools. The tools change constantly, the basis does not.</p>

      <p class="idea-label">Experience</p>

      <div class="">
        <p class="idea-text" id="idea3-01">My experience at Significa over these last 4 months definitely surpassed my expectations.</p>

        <p class="idea-text" id="idea3-02">I never thought that I would be able to work on real projects as an intern. So the U.Dream and the Peladrone projects were an exciting surprise.</p>

        <p class="idea-text" id="idea3-03">Working on both of these allowed me to gain a lot of insight on what goes into the making of an interface other than the design itself.</p>

        <p class="idea-text" id="idea3-04">The facilitation that occurs between the designer, the PM and the client are essential for a projects success.</p>

        <p class="idea-text" id="idea3-05">Not to forget as well, the collaboration with the fellow designers and developers.</p>

        <p class="idea-text" id="idea3-06">Every project has its own needs and wants but it's the lines of communication that are transversal to any.</p>

        <p class="idea-text" id="idea3-07">When it comes to the design, these projects allowed me to get in touch with the methodology of UI design.</p>

        <p class="idea-text" id="idea3-08">At the same time I was able to explore two different realms: the website and the app.</p>

        <p class="idea-text" id="idea3-09">Something very important and valuable for my learning was being able to get a closer look on everyone's projects and way of working.</p>

        <p class="idea-text" id="idea3-010">In retrospective, something that I didn't do but feel like is very relevant would be to understand the developers concerns and needs more closely, specially the frontend.</p>

        <p class="idea-text" id="idea3-011">Looking back I can see a huge evolution. This experience was very impactful and I can't thank you enough for your generosity, patience and support.</p>

        <p class="idea-text" id="idea3-012">A big thank you to you all! <3</p>
